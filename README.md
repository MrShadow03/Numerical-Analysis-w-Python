## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Numerical Analysis** is a branch of mathematics that deals with algorithms for solving mathematical problems numerically â€” that is, using approximations. It plays a critical role in scientific computing, engineering, data analysis, and machine learning.

Python, with its powerful scientific libraries like `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Matplotlib`, makes it an ideal language for experimenting with and visualizing numerical algorithms.
